#Spray Workshop

Welcome to Acme Corp!

As a new employee, we are happy to inform you of your first task. 
The task involves adding a REST interface to a legacy service.

The service allows you to:
 1. Upload a file
 2. Download a file
 3. Delete a file
 4. Add a file to a folder
 5. List the files by folder
 6. Remove a file from a folder

You should provide a REST interface that exposes all of these operations.
Make sure they work, we have customers in production waiting for it.

Good luck!
